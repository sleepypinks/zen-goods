### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of the application is to show users recipes of their choice. The application values people's dietary restrictions and informs users of their needs. It shows vegan friendly and gluten free recipes. 

### Usability Principles Considered

* Effectivity:
The application is effective as it has a menu on the right hand side allowing for quick filters. The user is not overloaded with information and quickly see which recipes take the longest (or shortest time) in addition to which recipes are vegan and gluten free. The design is simple and easy to access.

* Consistency & Readability: 
Each item is consistent with a clear title, description, cook time and vegan/gluten free information. The text is reduced by showing images for vegan and gluten options.

* Design & Layout:
Text is arranged in a way to be read easily by using bootstrap's title, and subtitle! The font and layout are user-friendly with enough padding and margins.

* Visibility:
Instead of a pop up, the favorites and filters are visible on the right of the screen. All the options are visible to the users and convey a consistent conceptual model.
